                Below is SortMethods.java a program that I wrote for CSC111, as well as 
                a game I made for CSC 110. Both are written in java. Sort Methods functions by randomly
                generating arrays and testing them on each sorting method. It then counts the amount of comparisons
                each sorting method took and reports them. The other project is for CSC110 and is a text based adventure game (please explore).
