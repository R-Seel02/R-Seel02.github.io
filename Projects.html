                Below is SortMethods.java a program that I wrote for CSC111, as well as 
                a game I made for CSC 110. Both are written in java. Sort Methods functions by randomly
                generating arrays and testing them on each sorting method. It then counts the amount of comparisons
                each sorting method took and reports them. The other project is for CSC110 and is a text based adventure game (please explore).

                Linked here is an RPG style game I worked on for my SER 225 Software development class. This was a group project
                executed with the "agile" technique of software development, my group and I created this game over many weeks. 
                (WASD to move, E to interact). This game takes place in a midevil world far away and features a protagonist who need to 
                defeat an evil king to save his town.
