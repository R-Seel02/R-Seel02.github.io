        <h1> Get to meet Ryan!</h1>
        <p> Hi there! I am Ryan Joseph Seely. I come from a small town in northern New Jersey
            called Pequannock. I graduated from Pequannock Township Highschool in 2023, while taking 
            multiple AP Courses, making honor roll, and being active in many clubs. During my time in Highschool
            I was also able to achive the rank of Eagle Scout, while also being a member for over ten years. Normally
            during the summer I normally work at my towns local golf course as a ranger. Although this previous summer I
            was fortunate enough to work an internship at an HiFi Audio Shop, managing their inventory systems. In my free time
            I like to play golf, cook, and attend car shows. I am currently studying SoftWare Engineering at Quinnipiac University,
            and I am an active member of Quinnipiac's Delta Upsilon Chapter. 
        </p>
